# Phone-Recommender

## Objective 
Build an application that recommends phones based on the user's budget. 

## Requirements
* User Story: I can select a budget 
* User Story: I can view 3 phone suggestions based on my budget
* User Story: I can buy the phone

## Results
You can view the live version of the phone recommender on: https://ajibs.github.io/Phone-Recommender/

## Notes
* The application was built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS
* The algorithm for choosing the particular phones to display was solely my intuition and common sense, having done some basic research on online stores.

## Possible Features
* A load more button; for the user to obtain 3 extra phone suggestions
* Learn more button; takes user to gsm arena with full phone specifications
* The "buy button" sends the website admin an email or sms detailing the phone
* Store phone images and buy links in a database 
* Retrieve phone images and buy links from the database (they are currently in the JS file)
